# Day 2 Solution

The key idea of they day 2 solution is using @schedule to create a schedule, specifying the assets for the schedule in target, and adding everything to a `Definitions` object.

```python
from dagster import asset, schedule, AssetSelection, SkipReason, RunRe

@asset
def a(): ...

@asset(
    deps = [a]
)
def b(): ...

@asset(
    deps = [b]
)
def c(): ...

@schedule(
    cron_schedule = "* * * * *",
    target = AssetSelection.assets("a", "b", "c")
)
def my_minutely_scheduale():
    return RunRequest()

defs = Definitions(
    assets = [a, b, c],
    schedules = [my_minutely_schedule]
)
```

`@schedule` is valuable because it allows you to handle complex scheduling situations independent from the actual job runs. For example:

```python
@schedule(
    cron_schedule = "* * * * *",
    target = AssetSelection.all()
)
def run_daily_except_holidays():
    if today() in my_corporate_calendar_holidays():
        return SkipReason("Not running because today is holiday")
    
    return RunRequest()
```
